This is a MEAN stack application that I built as a class project for an Angular2 NodeJS class. The database is hosted on Mongodb.com 
and it is deployed on Heroku at https://lisanode-angular.herokuapp.com. Features include authentication and the ability to create, edit, 
delete, and update messages.
